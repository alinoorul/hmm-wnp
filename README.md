# hmm-wnp
Hidden Markov Model from Pomegranate and hmmlearn (Python) used to analyze Leo Tolstoy's War and Peace to infer difference in usage of alphabets

RESULT: 2 different sets are obtained from the learnt model, just from the usage of alphabets in War and Peace. These are vowels and consonants. Thus a Hidden Markov Model recognized that there are 2 different categories of alphabets, just by analyzing their usage in a corpus, without being explicitly told so. Can be used in artificial intelligence.
